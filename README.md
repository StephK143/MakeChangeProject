# MakeChangeProject


## Cash register
This cash register returns the change due to the customer in denominations. The value of the balance is broken down into coins and bills so that the user can just make change without doing any math.

##Technologies used
Written in Java.
IDE is Eclipse. 
Git
GitHub. 

## What I learned
Learning Java as a language, how to use Eclipse, GitHub, Git, Terminal command line.

Using methods, loops, importing scanner and basic Java knowledge syntax.
 
I learned that making multiple sysouts can help you easily find mistakes.

For rounding: I didn't want to use the Decimal.format because this makes your double into a string. Then you can't make calculations so I used (int)(Math.round(num1 * 100)). 
The first time I wrote this it was considerably longer. I am learning to shorten the code for easier readability.
